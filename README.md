# Hotel Management System

This project is designed to manage a small-sized tourist hotel efficiently by automating various operations, including room reservations, housekeeping shifts, maintenance operations, financial movements, and invoice generation. The goal is to centralize hotel operations into one comprehensive database system that can be accessed by both employees and management, based on their assigned permissions.

## Overview

Investment in hotels is one of the most important sectors in tourism. Hotels are essential for both local and foreign tourists. A small-sized hotel project, unlike large and luxurious hotels, focuses on managing essential functions in an organized and cost-effective manner.

The hotel operating supplies include:
- Beds, mattresses, pillows, bedspreads, and covers.
- Televisions in every room.
- A table and two chairs in each room.
- Wardrobes, safes, and water kettles in every room.
- Internet routers on each floor.
- Reception furniture and bathroom fittings.
- Kitchen equipment for hotels providing catering services.

## Goals

The main goals of the hotel management system are:
- Automate hotel operations.
- Manage room reservations and housekeeping shifts.
- Control periodic maintenance operations.
- Track financial transactions and generate detailed electronic invoices.
- Organize and manage a central database that can be accessed by different roles (e.g., management, employees) based on permissions.

## Database Specifications and Requirements

### 1. **Hardware Analysis**:
- **Server Hardware**: 
  - Enterprise-level server with sufficient processing power, memory, and storage capacity.
- **Client Peripherals**:
  - Laptops or desktop computers with:
    - **Processor**: Intel Core i5 or higher, clock speed of at least 2.5 GHz.
    - **RAM**: Minimum 8GB.
    - **Hard Disk**: Minimum 500GB (HDD or SSD).
    - **Display**: Minimum 17-inch monitor, LCD or LED.
    - **DVD Drive**: Optional.

### 2. **Software Analysis**:
- **Operating System**: Compatible with server and client devices (Windows Server, Windows, or MacOS).
- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: 
  - Suitable DBMS options include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server.
- **Networking**: 
  - Ensure network infrastructure (wired or wireless) supports communication between server and client devices.

### 3. **Database Requirements**:
- **Data Structure**:
  - The database should include tables, fields, and relationships to manage hotel-related data like guest information, room details, reservations, billing, and inventory.
- **Data Security**:
  - Implement security measures like encryption, access control, and regular backups to protect sensitive data.
- **Performance and Scalability**:
  - The database should be designed to handle future growth, ensuring good performance under heavy load (e.g., large data volume, many concurrent users).
- **Data Integration**:
  - Ensure the database can integrate with other hotel systems like point-of-sale, booking engines, or accounting software.
- **Data Reporting and Analysis**:
  - The system should support report generation and data analysis to provide insights and business intelligence.
